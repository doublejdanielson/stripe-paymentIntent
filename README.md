This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Additionally, I locally ran the server using the following command:

### `node .\server.js`

Here I am outputting a note when the server start running and whenever a secret is requested (as requesting a secret was the part I spent the most time trying to figure out.)

That's it, I hope.
